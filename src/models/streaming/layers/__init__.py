"""
Streaming-compatible layer implementations.

This package provides drop-in replacements for standard layers that enable
streaming inference:

- StatefulCausalConv1d/2d: State-buffering convolutions
- Reshape-Free layers: Conv2d-based layers eliminating reshape operations

Example:
    >>> from src.models.streaming.layers import (
    ...     StatefulAsymmetricConv2d,
    ...     ReshapeFreeTSBlock,
    ... )
