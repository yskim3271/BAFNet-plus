"""
CPU inference optimizations: BN folding.

Provides BN folding optimization for CPU streaming inference:

**BN Folding**: Fuses Conv2d+BatchNorm2d (and ConvTranspose2d+BatchNorm2d)
pairs into single convolution layers, eliminating BN computation overhead.

Usage:
    >>> from src.models.streaming.cpu_optimizations import fold_batchnorm
    >>> model, fused_count = fold_batchnorm(model)
